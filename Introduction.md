The HTML Component Framework allows the developer to create reusable modular GUI parts (components) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. These components can then be used to build web applications.

Because each component's content, style and behaviour is managed in ordinary HTML, CSS and JavaScript files they are quick to test (they can be opened directly in a browser without the need of a server or compilation stage), and easy to understand (the content is written in an HTML file and kept separate from the behaviour that is written in a JavaScript file).

The components work cross-domain, which means that a web application hosted in one domain can use components hosted or used by web applications in other domains. This saves on the need to make copies of component code; keeps the original component author in control should they need to immediately roll out a fix or update; enables the creation of component mashups where data from different sources can be manipulated and displayed from within a single web application.
